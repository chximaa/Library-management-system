📚 Library Management System (PL/SQL)

This project is a work-in-progress Library Management System developed using Oracle PL/SQL.
It aims to demonstrate key database programming concepts such as data manipulation, transaction control,
procedures, functions, triggers, and loops in PL/SQL.

The goal of this system is to simulate the basic operations of a small library, including managing books,
members, and borrowing records — all handled through PL/SQL code blocks.
